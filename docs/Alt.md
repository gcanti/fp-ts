# Alt

```ts
interface Alt<F> extends Functor<F> {
  readonly alt: <A>(fx: HKT<F, A>, fy: HKT<F, A>) => HKT<F, A>
}
```

Added in v1.0.0 (type class)

The `Alt` type class identifies an associative operation on a type constructor. It is similar to `Semigroup`, except
that it applies to types of kind `* -> *`, like `Array` or `Option`, rather than concrete types like `string` or
`number`.

`Alt` instances are required to satisfy the following laws:

1. Associativity: `A.alt(A.alt(fa, ga), ha) = A.alt(fa, A.alt(ga, ha))`
2. Distributivity: `A.map(A.alt(fa, ga), ab) = A.alt(A.map(fa, ab), A.map(ga, ab))`
