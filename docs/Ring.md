# Ring

**Signature** (type class) [Source](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts/blob/master/src/Ring.ts#L14-L16)

```ts
export interface Ring<A> extends Semiring<A> {
  readonly sub: (x: A, y: A) => A
}
```

The `Ring` class is for types that support addition, multiplication, and subtraction operations.

Instances must satisfy the following law in addition to the [Semiring](./Semiring.md) laws:

- Additive inverse: `a - a = (zero - a) + a = zero`

```ts
export const getFunctionRing = <A, B>(ring: Ring<B>): Ring<(a: A) => B> => { ... }
```

Added in v1.0.0

## getProductRing

**Signature** (function) [Source](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts/blob/master/src/Ring.ts#L40-L48)

```
