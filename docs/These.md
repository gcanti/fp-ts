## these

```ts
Functor2<URI> & Bifunctor2<URI> & Foldable2v2<URI> & Traversable2v2<URI>
```

Added in v1.0.0 (instance)

# These

```ts
type These<L, A> = This<L, A> | That<L, A> | Both<L, A>
```

Added in v1.0.0 (data)

A data structure providing "inclusive-or" as opposed to [Either](./Either.md)'s "exclusive-or".

If you interpret `Either<L, A>` as suggesting the computation may either fail or succeed (exclusively), then
`These<L, A>` may fail, succeed, or do both at the same time.

There are a few ways to interpret the both case:

- You can think of a computation that has a non-fatal error.
- You can think of a computation that went as far as it could before erroring.
- You can think of a computation that keeps track of errors as it completes.

Another way you can think of `These<L, A>` is saying that we want to handle `L` kind of data, `A` kind of data, or
both `L` and `A` kind of data at the same time. This is particularly useful when it comes to displaying UI's.
