# Overview

A meet-semilattice (or lower semilattice) is a semilattice whose operation is called `meet`, and which can be thought
of as a greatest lower bound.

A `MeetSemilattice` must satisfy the following laws:

- Associativity: `a ∧ (b ∧ c) = (a ∧ b) ∧ c`
- Commutativity: `a ∧ b = b ∧ a`
- Idempotency: `a ∧ a = a`
