# Overview

A join-semilattice (or upper semilattice) is a semilattice whose operation is called `join`, and which can be thought
of as a least upper bound.

A `JoinSemilattice` must satisfy the following laws:

- Associativity: `a ∨ (b ∨ c) = (a ∨ b) ∨ c`
- Commutativity: `a ∨ b = b ∨ a`
- Idempotency: `a ∨ a = a`
