# Installation

To install the stable version:

```
npm install --save fp-ts
```

# TypeScript compatibility

The stable version is tested against TypeScript 2.5.x, but should run with TypeScript 2.2.2+ too

# Technical overview

The idea (faking higher kinded types in TypeScript) is based on

- [Lightweight higher-kinded polymorphism](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jdy22/papers/lightweight-higher-kinded-polymorphism.pdf)
- [elm-brands](https://github.com/joneshf/elm-brands)
- [Higher kinded types in TypeScript, static and fantasy land](https://medium.com/@gcanti/higher-kinded-types-in-typescript-static-and-fantasy-land-d41c361d0dbe)
