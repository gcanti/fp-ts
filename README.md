# Typed functional programming in TypeScript

`fp-ts` is a library for _typed functional programming_ in TypeScript.

`fp-ts` aims to allow developers to use _popular patterns and abstractions_ that are available in most functional languages. For this, it includes the most popular data types, type classes and abstractions such as [Option](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/Option.ts), [Either](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/Either.ts), [IO](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/IO.ts), [Task](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/Task.ts), [Functor](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/Functor.ts), [Applicative](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/Applicative.ts), [Monad](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/modules/Monad.ts) to empower users to write pure FP apps and libraries built atop higher order abstractions.

A distinctive feature of `fp-ts` with respect to other functional libraries is its implementation of [Higher Kinded Types](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kind_(type_theory)>), which TypeScript doesn't support natively.

# Installation

To install the stable version:

```
npm install fp-ts
```

Make sure to always have a single version of `fp-ts` installed in your project. Multiple versions are known to cause `tsc` to hang during compilation. You can check the versions currently installed using `npm ls fp-ts` (make sure there's a single version and all the others are marked as `deduped`).

## TypeScript compatibility

**Strictness** â€“ This library is conceived, tested and is supposed to be consumed by TypeScript with the `strict` flag turned on.

| `fp-ts` version | required `typescript` version |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 2.0.x+          | 3.5+                          |
| 1.15.x+         | 3.1+                          |
| <= 1.14.4       | 2.8+ (\*)                     |

(\*) If you are running `< typescript@3.0.1` you have to polyfill the `unknown` type. You can use [unknown-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/unknown-ts) as a polyfill.
