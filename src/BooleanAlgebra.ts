/**
 * @file Boolean algebras are Heyting algebras with the additional constraint that the law of the excluded middle is true

 *
 * Instances should satisfy the following laws in addition to the `HeytingAlgebra` laws:
 *
 * - Excluded middle: `a ∨ ¬a = 1`
 *
 * Boolean algebras generalize classical logic: one is equivalent to "true" and zero is equivalent to "false".
