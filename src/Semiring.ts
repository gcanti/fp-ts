/**
 * The `Semiring` class is for types that support an addition and
 * multiplication operation.
 *
 * Instances must satisfy the following laws:
 *
 * - Commutative monoid under addition:
 *   - Associativity: `(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)`
 *   - Identity: `zero + a = a + zero = a`
 *   - Commutative: `a + b = b + a`
 * - Monoid under multiplication:
 *   - Associativity: `(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)`
 *   - Identity: `one * a = a * one = a`
 * - Multiplication distributes over addition:
 *   - Left distributivity: `a * (b + c) = (a * b) + (a * c)`
 *   - Right distributivity: `(a + b) * c = (a * c) + (b * c)`
 * - Annihilation: `zero * a = a * zero = zero`
 *
 * **Note:** The `Number` and `Int` types are not fully law abiding
 * members of this class hierarchy due to the potential for arithmetic
 * overflows, and in the case of `Number`, the presence of `NaN` and
 * `Infinity` values. The behaviour is unspecified in these cases.
